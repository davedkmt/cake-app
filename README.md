# cake is a resturant app, built using MySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars.

* The app lets users input the name of a cake they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a cake's name, the app will display the cake -- waiting to place order.

* Each cake in the waiting area also has an order it! button.

* The app will store every cake in a database, whether ordered or not or not.
